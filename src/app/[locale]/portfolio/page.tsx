The education sector was one of many hit by lockdown restrictions, as it meant traditional learning in the classroom was no longer possible and the pressure shifted onto parents, who were overwhelmed by the range of online learning resources, not knowing where to start or how to use them.",

The platform was built using React and Ruby on Rails.",
