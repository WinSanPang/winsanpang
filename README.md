## Hello ðŸ‘‹

Hello, I'm Win ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to the code behind my personal website which serves as an interactive version of my CV, with more fun and information about me!

This is my 2nd build of my own website (you can see my previous 1st attempt from 4 years ago as a Junior Frontend Engineer using React [here](https://winsanpang.netlify.app/).)

I chose to rebuild it as a way of showcasing my new skills and progression - I believe this new website reflects my current style a lot better. Whilst I currently mainly work in React and Sass, I chose to try out NextJS and Tailwind CSS on this project for fun and my own learning.

If you're interested in looking at this website locally, feel free to clone the repository and run yarn dev in your local version of the project directory.

If you have any thoughts or suggestions, feel free to reach out and drop me a message!
